# Rectangular-Square-Tube-Joint-Visualization

This repository contains a small visualization project for a rectangular-to-square tube joint. 

**Status:** Project skeleton — minimal UI and renderer present in `src/`.

**Demo:** Run locally with `npm install` and `npm start` (see Getting Started).

## Features

- Lightweight renderer for visualizing tube-joint geometry in the browser
- Minimal UI scaffold in `src/index.html` and `src/renderer.js`
- Styles in `src/styles.css` for quick prototyping

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)

Install

```powershell
npm install
```

Run (development)

```powershell
npm start
```

This will open the project in your default browser (see `package.json` scripts).

## Project Structure

- `main.js` — Electron main (if applicable) or top-level launcher
- `package.json` — project metadata and scripts
- `src/`
	- `index.html` — app entry page
	- `renderer.js` — front-end logic and visualization code
	- `styles.css` — styling
- `.gitignore` — generated ignore rules

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
2. Start the app (`npm start`).
3. Open dev tools or adjust `src/renderer.js` to change visualization parameters.
